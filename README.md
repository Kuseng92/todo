# Todo List App in Flutter
This repository contains the source code for a simple yet functional Todo List application built using Flutter. The app demonstrates basic Flutter concepts and state management in a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- Two Tabs Interface: The app is divided into two tabs: 'To Do' and 'Completed', allowing users to organize tasks efficiently.
- Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to the 'To Do' list using a floating action button which opens a dialog to enter the task.
- Mark Tasks as Completed: Tasks in the 'To Do' list can be marked as completed, which moves them to the 'Completed' tab.
- Delete Tasks: Tasks in the 'Completed' tab can be deleted from the list.
- State Management: The app uses setState to manage the state of tasks, demonstrating state management in Flutter.
App Structure
- MyApp Class: The root of the application which runs the main app widget.
- TodoList Class: A StatefulWidget that manages the state of the todo list.
- TodoListState Class: Contains the logic and UI for the todo list, including adding, completing, and removing tasks.
